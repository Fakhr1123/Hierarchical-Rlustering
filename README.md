With an area reaching 5,749.89 kmÂ², it is dominated by coastal and hilly areas. Apart from the fisheries sector, Pesisir Selatan Regency also has natural potential in the agricultural sector. Food and horticultural commodities are superior commodities in supporting the improvement of the people's economy. The pandemic that occurred between 2019 and 2022 shut down the economic wheels of society, including the agricultural sector.
